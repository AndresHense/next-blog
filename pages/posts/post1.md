There is an old saying of Socrates that says: 
> I only know that I don't know nothing

And I hope that at the end of this post, you can understand that in fact you do not understand half the words that I'm writing. But **why it is so?**

## The Fundaments of a Sentence

Let's see, a text is a bunch of paragraphs. And a paragraph is a bunch of sentences, makes sense? I think so, but stop, we don't define what a sentence is, so **What it is?**

A sentence is a conjunt of propositions that forms a pattern, generally the pattern has a subject, a verb and a predicate, let's analyze the quote of Socrates:

- "I": this is the subject
- "only know that": this is the verb, to know.
- "I don't know nothing": this is the predicate, that at the same time is a proposition.

Notice that the sentence is built uppon words, the words that are not connectors like (and, that, so, but, etc..) are what in logic we call terms.
I is a term, know is a term, nothing is a term and so on.

To really understand a sentence one has to understand **all** the terms, and the relations that the terms are taking in the sentence, let's go back again to the quote, **What are the terms?**

1. I
2. know
3. nothing

**Do we really understand those terms?** to answer that question one has to ask, for each term:

1. What is I?
2. What is to know?
3. What is nothing?

Those are really big questions, if you can answer them... then I would expect you to be a kind of God. You may think that I'm crazy, of course that you can answer such easy questions may you think, well, let me try to answer them, and then maybe you can see of what I'm talking.

1. What is I?
> Well, I am me.
2. What what is me?
> Me is the person that is writing this answer right now.
3. What is a person?
> A person is a human.
4. All persons are humans?
> Yes...
5. What is a human?
> An animal that can think.
6. How can you assert that the humans are the only animal that can think?
> I can't...
7. What is a human?
> An animal that can think, has two legs, two arms, two eyes, etc...
8. If a person loss a limb, then that person is not human anymore?
> ...
> An animal that can think, and in the moment that is born has two legs, two arms...
9. If a person is born without a limb, then is not human?
> damn, what wikipedia say about humans?
> Human is a species of primate, characterized by bipedality and large, complex brains
10. What is a specie?
11. What is a primate?
> Let's suppose that we know those things...
12. All humans are persons?
> Yes...
13. Then what is the difference between human and person? or are those words synonimous?
> I don't thing that they are synonimous, a person is a human who can think.
14. Fetus are not persons?
> With this definition no.
15. You have said "__person that is writing this answer right now__", I is the person in the present?
> I'm not my I in the future, that is for sure, but if I do affirm that I'm the I of the present, then I am not the I of the past, for if that where true, then I would be able to be in the past at the same time that I'm in the present. Like if where some sort of god, and I'm pretty sure that I'm not that.
16. What is the present?
> The present is what I can sense with my body right now, and the time in what my toughts are taking place.
17. What is to sense?
18. What is a body?
19. What is right now?
20. What is time?
21. What is a place?
22. What is  to think?
23. What is a tought?
> Aaah, soo much questions, let me stop, I want to stop.

And yet I'm still don't getting what is I, maybe you have more luck answering this question. 
Well, that if you are still able to affirm that you know what is luck. **What is luck?**
