There is an interesting ontological problem in philosophy that says: _Where lays the human and why?_

Kreeft(2010) Argues that humasn lie between computer and apes; and what distiguish an human is his capacity to ask questions. That is an hilarious answer if one ahs in count that Kreeft is of Christian religion.
Still, it is noteworthy to see how the computer is slowly reemplazing the place of God in philosophy.

Anyways, questions are the object of this writing, more specifically what Aristotle says about it, there is an history of one of Aristotle's lectures where no one of his students asked a single question after the lecture was over, so Aristotle said: 
> My lecture was about levels of intelligence in the universe, and I distinguished three such leves: gods, mens and brutes. Men are distinguished from both gods and brutes by questioning, for the gods know too much to ask questions and the brutes know too little. So if you have no questions, shall I congratulate you for having risen to the level of the gods, or insult you for having sunk to the levels of the brutes?

I can't help myself but feel an intense excitment at reading such qoute, the more delightful kind of questions are the ones more prone to be pervasive at the efforts that one put in answer them, and this one has been sliding from my hands for a few years by now. So, what is this so delightful question?

## What it takes to be able to ask questions?

Aristotle give us an glimpse of answer, by describing the brutes as the ones who knows too little. I do think that it is an incomplete answer, but let's build from there.
There is an implicit term in Aristotle description, maybe by throuwing it to the light we can have a better understanding of the problem:
### Know too little about what?

I'll say that the things they know too little are from a **body of knowledge**, and the reaseon why they can't formulate questions is that a body of knowledge is build uppon layers of concepts, let me show you an example: 
```
2*3=6
```
How it is possible to a man to wonder about the meaning of this simple expression if he does not know what the symbol 2 and the others symbols represent?
A priori knowledge in needed then to be able to formulate question of more advanced concepts of a given body of knowledge.
But Aristotle's argument ends here. And I argue that this is not enough to answer the original question. After all being able to do something is not sufficient condition to do that something. There has to be something more. But let's assume that we already have that priori knowledge.

### If one has the knowledge required to ask a question, What it takes to be able to ask that question?

Let me reframe what a question is: _a question is an action preformed by a human_. And an action only occurs when there is a **motive** to do that action.
Now I can also reframe my original question as follows:

## What motivates one to ask questions?

To answer that question one has to answer first the following:

### What is a motive?

A motive is a reason strong enough to led to action, it can be rational, or emotional, it can come from within (intrinsic motive), or from the outside (extrinsic motive), it can be conscious or not, it can be to seek pleasure or to avoid suffering. And there is rarely one single motive involved in any particular action, motives compete 24/7 to create actions, not only that, Schwartz(2008) argues that various motives can compete to led to the same action, and only one can success, and by doing so the result changes drastically than if another motive where to have succesed.
Motives are, as you can see, a deep subject that I shall not boast understanding about, furthermore to really understand what motivates humans to ask questions is to understand what motivates humans in the first place, and in undestanding it one has to deeply understand human nature in itself.

It seems that this question would continue to be unanswered by this writer for a few more years to say the at least.
